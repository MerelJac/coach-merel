3. Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection in the server code.

4. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add your JWT secret key and other environment variables.

5. Start the server by running the appropriate script (e.g., `npm start` or `yarn start`) in the server directory.

## Usage
This is a fitness application that will help users track their fitness progress. After a user registers or logs in there are options to create a new workout which will calculate your one rep max, then can access these saved workouts on the stats page. In future development the users will be able to update and remove exercises as well as access a random workout generator. There will also be a changing "suggestions" sections based on what part of the body you want to work on. There is also a button to change from dark mode to light mode depending on the user's preference. The app is styled with high contrast for accessability.
